# Introduction

# How to add to your global scripts index
## First option
You can add a powershell alias to your profile, for more information, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57838060/how-to-make-a-powershell-script-avaiable-from-anywhere

## Second option

1. Create a folder for your scripts to be stored in (For example, c:\PSScripts)
1. Add this folder to your %path%, this page can tell you about this: https://community.spiceworks.com/t/how-to-run-a-poweshell-script-from-any-path-from-local/727191
1. Once added, reboot your terminal, then try running a script that's been copied

It's worth noting, I don't quite remember if this works.
